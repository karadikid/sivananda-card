          Headstand (Sirsasana)
        </h1>
        <p>
          Known as the ‘king of the asanas’ for its remarkable benefits, the
          posture improves circulation, strengthens the respiratory system and
          heart, increases memory, concentration and intellectual capacity and
          promotes relaxation. The brain, spinal cord and sympathetic nervous
          system are vitalised and the senses sharpened. The pituitary and
          pineal glands are stimulated, revitalising the entire mind and body.
          The inversion relieves varicose veins and constipation, counteracts
          nervous disorders and anxiety, improves the quality of sleep and
          increases confidence.

          Shoulderstand (Sarvangasana)
        </h1>
        <p>
          Sarvangasana, meaning ‘all parts’ strengthens the entire body. The
          posture stimulates the thyroid gland regulating metabolism, protein
          synthesis, heart rate, blood pressure and calcium levels. The blood is
          purified and circulation improved, and the posture aids in the
          prevention of kidney disease, bone disease and muscle weakness.
          Varicose veins and constipation are relieved and mental sluggishness,
          depression and insomnia removed.

        </h1>
        <p>
          The Plough keeps the entire spine youthful by stretching the spinal
          muscles and opening up the spinal discs. It nourishes the spinal
          nerves and relieves and prevents back and neck arthritis and
          stiffness. The muscles of the back, shoulders and arms are
          strengthened and tension from the cervical region of the spine
          released. By massaging the internal organs, indigestion and
          constipation are relieved, the liver and spleen stimulated and obesity
          reduced.

          The Fish strengthens and cleanses the respiratory system, increasing
          lung capacity, relieving asthma and bringing increased vitality to the
          entire system. Stiffness from the cervical, thoracic and lumbar
          regions of the back are removed correcting the hunched back/shoulder
          syndrome of modern-day living and the nerves of the neck and back are
          simultaneously toned. The parathyroid glands in the back of the neck
          which are responsible for calcium uptake are stimulated resulting in a
          stronger and more plastic skeletal system. Moods are regulated and
          emotions calmed.

          power. The functions of the pancreas are regulated controlling blood

          stretched increasing flexibility in the hips. Excess weight in the
